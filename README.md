# Pointless-Python

Each "script" in this repo was produced out of sheer bordem.
Each can be transported to any of your own projects for use like so:
```
import aesthetic
aesthetic.aesthetic('input')
```
You may use each of these as you wish as long as you keep my attributions within the code.

###### Enjoy
